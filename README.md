Server-client application that reproduces the game of Rock - Paper - Scrissors - Lizard - Spock. The client will send the option to the server, at which point the server will randomly generate an option and send it to the client if it won or not. It is also possible to connect to the server up to a maximum of 3 clients who can play that game simultaneously. Each plays independently with the server. (eg. if player 1 loses, then the game continues for player 2 and player 3. Next, if player 3 loses, player 2 continues his game with the server until he loses / wins)

INPUT: server.py client.py  
OUTPUT: The answer to each client - whether they won or not - along with all the options chosen.
